Intake: To open a new ticket, go to your web browser and navigate to the end user osTicket site. Here you have the option to either open a new ticket or check the status of an existing ticket. From here, you input contact information and the specific help topic that needs attending to before selecting > Create Ticket.

Assignment and Communication: Typically a queue manager or lead will go through and check the tickets to make sure the priorities and SLAs make sense before assigning them out. However, for the sake of this demonstration we are the Admin and to assign yourself or another agent a ticket, simply open the ticket and click on where it says "Unassigned" to browse assignment options.

<p>
Working the Issue and Resolution: These two steps really go hand in hand as you are wrapping up a ticket. Working the ticket means you are actively researching or fixing the reported issue. You won't always be able to fix every problem you receive, so communicating with and transferring the ticket to another department that might be able to is another option to finding a solution.

In the notes section of the ticket, give the customer/ worker a brief description of what was fixed before scrolling down to Ticket Status and selecting "Resolved"
