Intake: To open a new ticket, go to your web browser and navigate to the end user osTicket site. Here you have the option to either open a new ticket or check the status of an existing ticket. From here, you input contact information and the specific help topic that needs attending to before selecting > Create Ticket.

Assignment and Communication: Typically a queue manager or lead will go through and check the tickets to make sure the priorities and SLAs make sense before assigning them out. However, for the sake of this demonstration we are the Admin and to assign yourself or another agent a ticket, simply open the ticket and click on where it says "Unassigned" to browse assignment options.
